# Manage posture checks

NetBird enables administrators to manage resource access through the creation of access policies, dictating which peer
groups can interact. Posture checks serve as an extension to these policies, augmenting their capabilities by allowing
administrators to enforce access restrictions based on specified criteria. By integrating posture checks seamlessly into
policy-based ACLs, NetBird evaluates various attributes to determine the eligibility of peers to connect to the network.
