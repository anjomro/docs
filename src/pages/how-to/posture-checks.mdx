# Posture Checks

NetBird enables administrators to manage resource access through the creation of access policies, dictating which peer
groups can interact. Posture checks serve as an extension to these policies, augmenting their capabilities by allowing
administrators to enforce access restrictions based on specified criteria. By integrating posture checks seamlessly into
policy-based ACLs, NetBird evaluates various attributes to determine the eligibility of peers to connect to the network.


## Concepts

### NB Version Check

The NB Version check verifies the version of NetBird installed on the device attempting to connect to the network.
This check ensures that only devices running a specified version of NetBird can gain access, thus preventing outdated or
incompatible clients from compromising network security.

### OS Version Check

The OS Version check evaluates the operating system (OS) version running on the connecting device.
This check allows for the enforcement of minimum OS requirements, ensuring that only devices with up-to-date and secure
operating systems can access network resources.

The check evaluates the actual OS version for Android, Darwin, and iOS, while for Linux and Windows, it assesses the
kernel version.

### Geo Check

The Geo Check examines the geographical location of the connecting device based on its connection IP address.
This check allows administrators to enforce access restrictions based on geographic regions, offering both a country-wide
and city-level granularity.

## Managing Posture Checks

### Creating posture check
Access the `Access Control` tab, the `Posture Checks` section and click `Create Posture Check`.

</p>

That will open a posture checks configuration screen where you can configure the checks.

</p>

In the example below, we are creating a posture check which will only allow the client running NetBird version `0.25.0`
or greater to connect and access the network resources.

Select `NetBird Client Version` check option and set with the following information:
- Version: `0.25.0`

<p>
    <img src="/docs-static/img/how-to-guides/netbird-version-check.png" alt="high-level-dia" className="imagewrapper"/>
</p>

Click `Save` and `NetBird Client Version` check will be enabled.
<p>

</p>

Click `Continue` and fill out the form wil the following information and click `Create Posture Check` to save:
- Name of the posture check: `Netbird Version`
- Description: `Allow Netbird client with version 0.25.0 or greater`
