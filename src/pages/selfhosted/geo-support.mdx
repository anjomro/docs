In NetBird, the Management system traditionally relies on Geolocation databases. Starting from version 0.26.0,
we have introduced initial support for posture checks. By default, the management uses the GeoLite2 City database from
[MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com) to evaluate the geographical location of the peer based on its connection IP address.
